1-D Model for the and Inductive Pulsed Plasma Thruster operating off back-fill injected Argon
This repository contains files for my master's thesis at the UW SPACE Lab in Aeronautics and Astronautics. My Research focused on the diagnostics and modeling of current sheets in inductive pulsed plasma thrusters (IPPTs). My advisor is Professor Justin Little, PhD.

See the Mathematica code for modeling of a IPPT with an injected Argon back-fill
